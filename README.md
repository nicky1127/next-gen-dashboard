# NeoBank - AI-Driven Virtual Bank

## Project Overview

NeoBank is a **next-generation AI-powered virtual bank** prototype built as a **React-based progressive web application**. This project serves as the foundation for a fully AI-driven banking platform that will revolutionize how customers interact with financial services.

## Purpose & Vision

This is the **initial prototype** for an AI bank incubation project focused on:

- **AI-First Banking**: Every interaction is powered by artificial intelligence
- **Progressive Customer Journey**: Seamless onboarding with real-time identity verification
- **Next-Generation UX**: Minimalist, clean design that builds trust while showcasing innovation

## Key Design Decisions

### **Why This Architecture?**

1. **Redux Toolkit**: Chosen for predictable state management as the app will have complex customer journey flows
2. **Material-UI**: Professional banking-grade components with extensive customization options
3. **Progressive Layout**: Allows the interface to evolve naturally with the customer journey
4. **Component Separation**: Each major UI area is isolated for independent development and testing

### **Styling Approach**

- **Minimalist Banking Theme**: Professional but not cold, with subtle AI-tech indicators
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach for modern banking expectations
- **Accessibility**: High contrast ratios and semantic HTML for compliance requirements
